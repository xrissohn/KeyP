## Artifacts

### KeyP (`artifacts/keyp`) — Mobile App
- **Kind**: Expo React Native (iOS/Android/Web)
- **Slug**: `keyp`, **Preview path**: `/`
- **Purpose**: 한국어 UI 실시간 관심사 알림 + 내부 상호매칭 앱
- **Stack**: Expo Router, AsyncStorage, @expo/vector-icons, expo-haptics

#### Architecture
- **Auth**: Mock auth via AsyncStorage (`context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **State**: App-wide context (`context/AppContext.tsx`) — interests, alerts, matches
- **URL reachability gate** (`artifacts/api-server/src/routes/agents.ts`): runs after Collector + backup-collector, before Verifier. HEAD-requests each candidate URL with 5s timeout (GET ranged-fallback for 405/501); drops 404/410/5xx and network failures. SSRF-hardened: rejects non-http(s), embedded creds, non-standard ports, and any host/redirect-hop resolving to loopback/private/link-local/multicast/metadata IPs (IPv4 + IPv6). Empty result → poller silently retries next sweep ("better silence than dead links").
- **AI Pipeline (specialized model per agent role, all via Replit AI Integrations — no user API keys, billed to credits)**:
  - `lib/agents/ApiClient.ts` — fetch wrapper hitting `/api/agents/*` endpoints
  - `lib/agents/PlannerAgent.ts` — calls `POST /api/agents/parse-interest`; keyword fallback on failure
  - `lib/agents/MockPipeline.ts` — calls `POST /api/agents/generate-alerts`; template fallback on failure
  - Server route: `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/agents.ts`
  - **Planner** = OpenAI **gpt-5.4** (`@workspace/integrations-openai-ai-server`) — JSON-mode structured extraction. Prompted as a **detective/private-investigator**: in addition to the normalized `InterestSpec`, it must infer a `targetPersona` (who the user is searching FOR — not the asker) and produce a `searchStrategy[]` of 4–7 ordered, named channels (specific subreddits like `r/AskNYC`, X handles, dating-app communities like `Hinge NYC` or `Meeff`, university KSAs, Naver cafes, hashtags) — each with a concrete query and a Korean rationale. Vague inputs MUST still produce ≥4 strategy entries by inferring the most plausible interpretation.
  - **SourceRouter** = deterministic priority calc (no LLM); reports the top channel from `searchStrategy` when present.
  - **Collector** = Perplexity **`perplexity/sonar-pro`** via OpenRouter (`@workspace/integrations-openrouter-ai`) — real web search. Reframed as a "public-content research assistant" so it never refuses person-related queries by interpreting them as PII; explicitly told it searches PUBLIC posts/articles/videos/threads/events ABOUT a topic, not individuals. Receives the Planner's `searchStrategy` as an explicit ordered investigation plan and is instructed to work it in order, falling back to adjacent public content when a specific channel is empty. Hard rule: **never return an empty `alerts` array** — broaden to adjacent content rather than returning nothing.
  - **Verifier** = Anthropic **`claude-sonnet-4-6`** (`@workspace/integrations-anthropic-ai`) — credibility & relevance scoring per candidate.
  - **Deliverer** = deterministic freshness×confidence sort (no LLM). Sort key is **content-recency** = `max(minutesAgo, eventMinutesAgo)`, so a 3-day-old article reporting a 1-hour-old real event beats a 1-hour-old republish of year-old gossip. The Collector now emits `eventHoursAgo` per item (parsed from article body — when the underlying event actually OCCURRED), and the Verifier penalizes stale-republish posts. **Seed guarantee**: when caller asks for `count=1` AND Verifier filtered everything, Deliverer rescues the freshest raw candidate at confidence=55 — but ONLY among candidates that pass the dedup gate, so seed rescue can never violate the prime directive.
  - **Prime directive — strict semantic dedup ("never duplicate")**: GenerateAlertsRequest accepts `existingAlertSummaries: {title,summary}[]` (last ~30 alerts the user already received for that interest). Both Collector and Verifier prompts receive this list; Verifier marks `include=false` for any candidate covering the same story (cross-source/wording) or duplicating an earlier in-batch item. Backup-collector pass also receives the list and the eventHoursAgo requirement. **Final dedup gate** in the Deliverer is the deterministic last line of defense (catches all upstream bypasses including Verifier-fail fallback): character-bigram Jaccard ≥0.45 over normalized `title + summary` (Korean-friendly, agglutinative-aware). Filters against `knownItems` AND in-batch first-occurrence-only. The mobile client (`AppContext.refreshInterest`) collects last-30 existing alerts per interest and forwards them; the server `pollerCron` (push background sweep) does the same from `seen_alerts` (currently `summary=title` since `seen_alerts` schema only stores title — adding a `summary` column is a future-work item to strengthen push-path dedup).
  - **All intent types run real web search** including `intentType=match` — earlier behavior of synthesizing internal mock match candidates was removed; the user wants real-world signals from the platforms where the target persona congregates.
  - **InterestSpec extension**: `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` adds `targetPersona: string?` and `searchStrategy: { channel, query, rationale }[]?`. Codegen regenerated; both client and server consume the new fields. Schema names use `*Result` (not `*Response`) to avoid collision with Orval's auto-generated response zod schemas.
  - **UI**: `app/interest/add.tsx` renders the actual server-returned `steps[]` (not hardcoded labels) via an `onSteps` callback piped through `AppContext.addInterest`. Renderer is server-driven: appends any unknown agents the server emits and uses dynamic total counts (no hardcoded `/5`). Stale callbacks from earlier requests are guarded by a `requestIdRef`.
  - **Source URLs**: `AlertSource.url` is part of the OpenAPI contract. The Collector extracts URLs from Perplexity citations; the Verifier preserves them through scoring; the Deliverer returns them in the response. The mobile client maps `source.url → AlertCard 출처 보기 button`, which calls `Linking.openURL` to open the original source externally.

#### Interest list & history UI
- `components/InterestCard.tsx` renders each interest with a red **NEW <count>** badge when `getNewAlertCount(interestId) > 0` (computed against `interest.lastViewedAt`).
- Tapping a card opens `app/interest/[id].tsx` which shows the interest spec + a newest-first **알림 히스토리** of all alerts for that interest. A `useEffect` calls `markInterestViewed(id)` ~600 ms after mount so the NEW pill is visible briefly before being cleared.
- `components/AlertCard.tsx` shows a "**출처 보기 · <source name>**" button when `alert.source.url` (or `originalUrl`) is present; tapping it calls `Linking.openURL(...)` to leave the app for the original source.
- **Critical invariant**: `Interest.id === Interest.spec.id`. Alerts reference `spec.id` as their `interestId`, so `AppContext.addInterest` assigns `newInterest.id = spec.id` to keep the detail screen filter (`alerts.filter(a => a.interestId === id)`) working. Diverging these IDs makes the history view permanently empty.

#### Realtime collection (background polling)
- `AppContext` exposes `refreshInterest(id)`, `refreshAllInterests()`, `refreshingInterestIds`, `lastBackgroundRunAt`, `autoCollectEnabled`, `autoCollectIntervalMs`.
- A `useEffect` runs a background sweep every `autoCollectIntervalMs` (default **2 minutes**) that sequentially refreshes every active interest. The first sweep fires 5s after mount.
- **Dedup**: incoming alerts are filtered against existing alerts for the same `interestId` by `source.url` (preferred) and normalized title (fallback). Only genuinely new items are appended.
- **Throttling**: a per-interest `lastRefreshedAt` cooldown (60s) and a single `sweepRunningRef` mutex prevent overlapping or concurrent fetches.
- **Stale-state safety**: `interestsRef` / `alertsRef` mirror the latest state so the polling closure never operates on a stale snapshot.
- **UI**: `(tabs)/interests.tsx` shows a collector status bar (green dot + interval label + "지금 수집" button + auto-collect Switch). `interest/[id].tsx` shows a per-interest "실시간 수집 중 · 마지막 수집: X분 전" row + "지금 수집" button.
- New alerts created by realtime sweeps are stamped `createdAt: now`, so the existing `getNewAlertCount`/NEW-badge logic surfaces them automatically.
- Settings persist to AsyncStorage under `@keyp/autoCollect`.

#### Fresh-start design + push notifications (v2)
- **Empty seed**: `data/mockData.ts` exports `MOCK_INTERESTS=[]`, `MOCK_ALERTS=[]`, `MOCK_MATCHES=[]`. New users start with zero data; everything is collected live.
- **Storage version bump**: `STORAGE_KEYS` now use `@keyp/v2/*` so legacy v1 dummy data is discarded. `loadFromStorage` also `multiRemove`s the old `@keyp/{interests,alerts,matches,autoCollect}` keys on every boot for one-time hygiene.
- **Single-seed semantics**: `addInterest` calls `generateAlertsForSpec(spec, 1)` so registering an interest fetches exactly ONE most-recent past relevant item as the seed alert. All subsequent alerts come from the realtime sweep loop and are de-duped before insertion.
- **Push notifications** (`lib/notifications.ts`):
  - Native: dynamic `import('expo-notifications')` so web bundles never resolve native-only code; `setNotificationHandler` shows banners/list/sound/badge in foreground; Android `setNotificationChannelAsync('keyp-default', { importance: HIGH })` is required for OEM reliability and `scheduleNotificationAsync` passes `{ channelId: 'keyp-default' }` on Android.
  - Web fallback: browser `Notification` API; permission requested once per session.
  - `notifyFreshAlerts(fresh[])` picks the freshest by `createdAt` to avoid spam when a sweep returns multiple.
  - `initNotifications()` is invoked once from the `AppProvider` mount `useEffect`.
  - Hooked from `addInterest` (seed alert) and from `refreshInterest` after dedup (`fresh.length > 0`).
- **Remote push pipeline (works when app is closed)**: implemented end-to-end via Expo Push Service.
  - **Client** (`lib/deviceId.ts`, `lib/notifications.ts`): on first launch we generate a persistent `deviceId` (`@keyp/v2/deviceId`). `initNotifications()` now also calls `registerExpoPushTokenOnce()` — gets the Expo push token via `getExpoPushTokenAsync({ projectId })` and POSTs `{deviceId, expoPushToken, platform}` to `/api/push/register-device`. `AppContext.addInterest` fires-and-forgets `POST /api/push/track-interest` with the spec; `deleteInterest` fires-and-forgets `DELETE /api/push/track-interest/:id`. All push API calls are non-blocking — failures degrade gracefully to client-side polling.
  - **Server** (`artifacts/api-server`):
    - DB (`lib/db/src/schema/`): `push_devices` (deviceId PK + expoPushToken + platform), `tracked_interests` (interestId PK + deviceId + spec JSONB + lastSweepAt + lastNewAt), `seen_alerts` (composite PK on interestId+dedupKey for idempotent dedup).
    - Routes (`routes/push.ts`): `register-device`, `track-interest` (upsert), `DELETE track-interest/:id` (cascades `seen_alerts`), `test`.
    - Expo dispatch (`services/expoPush.ts`): single POST to `https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send`; tickets with `details.error === "DeviceNotRegistered"` cause the caller to evict the token row.
    - Background poller (`services/pollerCron.ts`, started from `src/index.ts` after `app.listen` with a 5s delay): a 30-second tick picks up to 10 interests whose `lastSweepAt` is NULL or older than 2 minutes, oldest-first. For each it loopbacks to `http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/api/agents/generate-alerts` (count=3, no code duplication of the agent pipeline), dedups candidates against `seen_alerts` by `url` or normalized title, INSERTs all fresh items into `seen_alerts` BEFORE dispatching push (so a crash mid-send can never re-deliver), then sends ONE push for the freshest item with an "(외 N건)" suffix when N>1. `lastSweepAt` always advances so a permanently-broken interest can't starve others. A process-wide `running` mutex prevents overlapping ticks within a single process — multi-instance scaling would need a DB-level row-lock or distributed lock.
  - **OpenAPI**: spec extended in `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` with the `push` tag and four endpoints; codegen produces zod validators (`Register/Track/PushTest{Body,Response}`) used by the server to validate inputs and outputs. **Naming caveat**: schemas were named `*Result` (not `*Response`) because Orval already generates `{operationId}Response` from the response body schema and identical names collide in the barrel export.

#### Notification limitations + caveats
- **Expo Go (SDK 53+)** removed remote push from the in-app runtime — `getExpoPushTokenAsync` will throw and the warning is swallowed. To exercise remote push end-to-end you need a dev build (`eas build --profile development`) or a real production build.
- The server-side poller and the client-side sweep both ingest into independent stores (server `seen_alerts` vs client `alerts` array). The client still dedups its own list against `source.url`/title, so you can see both: a push delivered while the app is closed AND the same item appearing in the in-app feed when you reopen.

#### Saved-알림 dummy → real bookmark migration (legacy, mostly dormant)
- `data/mockData.ts` seeds two saved alerts (`alert_002`, `alert_005`) with placeholder URLs (e.g. `https://youtube.com`, `https://example.com`) so the **저장한 알림** screen isn't empty on first launch.
- `lib/utils/url.ts` `isPlaceholderUrl()` flags bare-domain URLs from a known set as placeholders; real Perplexity URLs (with paths) are NOT flagged.
- `AppContext` migrates these dummy bookmarks onto genuine fetched alerts via three coordinated layers (all use functional `setAlerts(prev => ...)` so React serializes against latest state):
  1. **Sweep-time migration** inside `refreshInterest`: when fresh real-URL alerts arrive, atomically transfer `isSaved`+`feedback` from any same-interest dummy bookmarks onto the freshest real alert (sorted by `createdAt`). Skips migration if no fresh alert has a non-placeholder URL — prevents moving a bookmark onto another placeholder.
  2. **Eager hydration migration**: a one-shot `useEffect` (gated by `eagerMigrationRanRef`) that runs after `hydrated`. For each dummy bookmark, picks the freshest real-URL alert in the same interest (by `createdAt`) from already-persisted alerts and migrates the bookmark immediately — no API call needed.
  3. **`upgradeSavedDummies()`**: exposed via context, called from `app/saved.tsx` on mount as a safety net for cold-start sessions. Iterates dummy bookmarks and calls `refreshInterest()` for each interest where no real alert (saved or unsaved) yet exists. The actual swap happens via the sweep-time migration above.
- The 60s `lastRefreshedAt` cooldown can delay (not block) migration when upstream returns empty/bad-JSON; retries occur on the next sweep cycle.
- **Types**: `types/index.ts` — InterestSpec, Alert, Match, User, etc.
- **Mock Data**: `data/mockData.ts` — sample interests, alerts, matches

#### Colors (Dark Theme)
- Background: `#0A0E1A`, Card: `#141929`
- Primary: `#5B7FFF` (electric blue), Accent: `#FF6B8A` (coral)
- Success: `#4ADE80`, Warning: `#FBBF24`
- Source colors: YouTube `#FF0000`, Twitter `#1D9BF0`, Reddit `#FF4500`

#### Key Design Decisions
- Local persistence via AsyncStorage; agent pipeline calls API server for real LLM
- Server validates LLM JSON output with Zod and falls back deterministically on schema mismatch
- Client sanitizes enum fields and falls back to local templates on transport/error failures
- NativeTabs with liquid glass on iOS 26+, BlurView tab bar on older iOS
- Full Korean UI throughout
- Interest add screen shows step-by-step agent pipeline visualization
